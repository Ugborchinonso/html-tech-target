                <b>Comment:</b> Achieving these will surely not be easy, but with determinaton coupled with hardwork it may be attainable. 
                <br> The major role you need to play is to set aside time for learning, connect with other developers and develop a plan for personal projects.
                <br> Once this is done, many other greater heights in this tech field will be within reach.
